- The login defect is a blocker, preventing user access and halting end-to-end testing.

- The transfer funds defect compromises financial integrity, allowing invalid transactions to be processed.

Given the severity of these issues in core banking workflows, the application is not ready for release.","1. Fix Critical Defects Before Release
- Block release until login and transfer funds defects are resolved.

2. Retest Impacted Modules
- Conduct regression testing on login and transfer funds flows after fixes.

3. Expand Negative Test Coverage
- Add tests for invalid inputs, boundary values, and concurrent transactions.

4. End-to-End Workflow Validation
- Re-test workflows from registration to fund transfers to confirm overall stability.

5. Environment Stability Check
- Investigate intermittent internal errors to ensure system reliability."
